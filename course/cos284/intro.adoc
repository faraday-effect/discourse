== Motivation
* Abstraction is _good_, but don’t forget _reality_
* Most CSE courses emphasize abstraction
** Abstract data types
** Asymptotic analysis
* Abstractions have limits
** Especially in the presence of bugs
** Understand details of underlying implementations
* Useful outcomes
** Become more effective programmers
*** Find and eliminate bugs efficiently
*** Understand and tune for program performance
** Prepare for later classes

== Programmer-Centric Course
* Purpose
** Show how ... +
by knowing more about the underlying system ... +
you can be a more effective programmer
* Enable you to
** Write programs that are more reliable and efficient
** Incorporate features that require hooks into OS
*** E.g., concurrency, signal handlers
** Not just for dedicated hackers
*** Bring out the hidden hacker in everyone!
* Cover material you won’t see elsewhere

= Five Great Realities

[sed]

[discrete]
= Reality #1

An `int` isn't an integer, a `float` isn't a real
--

[sed]
--
Example 1:  Is stem:[x^2 \ge 0]?

* For a `float`: _yes_
* For an `int`:
** stem:[40000 \times 40000 = 1600000000]
** stem:[50000 \times 50000 = ] ??

Example 2: Is stem:[(x + y) + z  =  x + (y + z)]?

* For `int`: _yes_
* For `float`
** stem:[(10^{20} + -10^{20}) + 3.14 = 3.14]
** stem:[10^{20} + (-10^{20} + 3.14) = ] ??

Similar to code found in FreeBSD’s implementation of `getpeername`

There are legions of smart people trying to find vulnerabilities in programs

= Reality #2

You've got to know assembly
--

* Probably never write assembly programs
** Compilers are much better and more patient
** But key to machine-level execution model
* Behavior of programs in presence of bugs
** High-level language models break down
* Tuning program performance
** Understand compiler optimizations
** Understand sources of program inefficiency
* Implementing system software
** Compiler has machine code as target
** Operating systems must manage process state
* Creating / fighting malware
** x86 assembly is the language of choice!

= Reality #3

Memory Matters
--

* Random Access Memory is an _abstraction_
* Memory is not unbounded
** It must be allocated and managed
** Many applications are memory dominated
* Memory referencing bugs pernicious
** Effects are distant in both time and space
* Memory performance is not uniform
** Cache and virtual memory effects can greatly affect program performance
** Adapting program to characteristics of memory system can lead to major speed improvements
* C and C++ do not provide any memory protection
** Out of bounds array references
** Invalid pointers
** Abuses of `malloc` and `free`
* Can lead to nasty bugs
** Depends on system and compiler
** Action at a distance
*** Corrupted object logically unrelated to one being accessed
*** Effect of bug may be first observed long after it is generated
* How can I deal with this?
** Program in Java, Ruby or ML
** Understand what possible interactions may occur
** Tools to detect referencing errors (e.g. `valgrind`)

----
--

* 21 times slower (Pentium 4)
* Memory is organized hierarchically
* Performance depends on access patterns
** Including stepping through multi-dimensional array

= Reality #4

Performance is about more than asymptotic complexity
--

* Constant factors matter too!
* Even exact op count doesn't predict performance
** Easily 10:1 performance range based on code written
** Optimize at multiple levels: algorithm, data representations, procedures, loops
* Must understand system to optimize
** How programs compiled and executed
** How to measure performance and identify bottlenecks
** How to improve performance without destroying code modularity and generality

= Reality #5

Computers do more than run programs
--

* Need to get data in and out
** I/O system critical to reliability and performance
* Communicate with over networks
** Many system-level issues arise
*** Concurrent operations by autonomous processes
*** Coping with unreliable media
*** Cross platform compatibility
*** Complex performance issues
